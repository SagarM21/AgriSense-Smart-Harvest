| Crop Health | Pesticides are also special, because while they protect the crop with the right dosage. But, if you add more than required, they may spoil the entire harvest. A high level of pesticide can deem the crop dead / unsuitable for consumption among many outcomes. This data is based on crops harvested by various farmers at the end of harvest season | [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/girishkurup/machine-learning-on-agriculture-dataset-nn) |
